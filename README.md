Windows desktop based game developed using Unreal’s UDK 3.0 engine. Most of the assets where created using a version of the Maya software and animated using Motionbuilder when necessary. When not developed by the development team, the assets where obtained and allowed to use by other artists close to the team.

The game consists in exploring the fantasy world of Bathangor and fighting to prevent the return of an evil deity and disrupting the peace the kingdoms now enjoy. The player has 3 city maps, 4 wilds based and one dungeon maps to explore and complete certain quests.
